About:
In the last few weeks, Santa Barbara has seen an unprecedented amount of marine mammals washing up on the shores of Santa Barbara. Previous research has suggested that a particular algal species, Pseudo-nitzschia, produces domoic acid, a neurotoxin that causes seizures, brain damage and death in marine mammal. These blooms can be greatly enhanced by run off, eutrophication, and El Nino cycling where strong upwelling years foster bloom all of which is ooccuring right now in Santa Barbara. These animal reports have been reported in coastal waters along the West Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and in the Gulf of Maine which also include anchovies, birds, and shellfish. 

Although rare in humans, consumption of seafood contaminated with domoic acid may result in a potentially lethal syndrome known as amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), which can short term memory loss along with a suite of other ailments, including gastrointestinal distress and neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, memory loss, weakness, seizures. ASP can be fatal and mortalities have occurred. 


Highlights of Study:
- Wrangling large datasets 
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Autocorrelation 
- Decomposition
- Climate Modeling 

Further directions:

Predict Future Trends to Reduce Environmental Effects
- Examine the lagged effect of temperature on the number of algae to analyze how an extreme change in temperature such as a heatwave may cause algae growth in the next week, month or year
- Explore more marine data to find spatial and temporal trends in mammal abundance and distribution before, during, and after a severe algal bloom event

Analyze Socioeconomic impacts:
- Algal blooms are associated with lost fisheries, lansing and tourism revenue, food insecurity from the loss of subsistence harvest, disruption of cultural practices
- Contaminated seafood, commercial and recreational fisheries closures are put into place when toxin levels in seafood exceed regulatory limits for human consumption (Dungeness Crab Fishery)
- The commercial Dungeness crab fishery experienced a $97.5 million (almost 47%) decrease in revenue compared to the previous year as a result of toxin levels exceeding regulatory limits
